## `virtual`

Certainly! Here's a more detailed explanation of what it means for a function to be virtual and how it can be overridden in derived classes:

In object-oriented programming, a class is a blueprint for creating objects. It defines the data and behavior that objects of that class will have. A class can also be derived from another class, in which case it is called a derived class or a subclass. The class from which the derived class is derived is called the base class or the superclass.

A virtual function is a member function of a class that can be redefined in derived classes. The virtual keyword is used to indicate that a function is virtual. When a virtual function is called through a reference or a pointer to an object of a derived class, the function implementation called is the one defined in the derived class, rather than the one defined in the base class.

Here's an example to illustrate this concept:

```cpp
Copy code
class Animal {
 public:
  virtual void makeSound() {
    cout << "Some generic animal sound" << endl;
  }
};

class Dog : public Animal {
 public:
  void makeSound() {
    cout << "Woof!" << endl;
  }
};

int main() {
  Animal animal;
  animal.makeSound();  // Outputs "Some generic animal sound"

  Animal* animal_ptr = new Dog;
  animal_ptr->makeSound();  // Outputs "Woof!"
  return 0;
}

```

In this example, **`makeSound`** is defined in the base class **`Animal`** as a virtual function. It is then overridden in the derived class **`Dog`**. When we call **`makeSound`** on an object of type **`Animal`**, the version of the function defined in the **`Animal`** class is called. However, when we call **`makeSound`** on a pointer to a **`Dog`** object, the version of the function defined in the **`Dog`** class is called. This is because the function is virtual, and the implementation called is determined at runtime based on the type of the object for which the function is called.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any questions.
